                                This type of cannabis is commonly taken by those
                                who want to sink into a state of total
                                relaxation in every limb. This reduces stress
                                overall and can take your worries and fatigue
                                away. Because of its relaxing effects, it is
                                suggested to use this type of cannabis at night.
                                It is particularly recommended for people who
                                have trouble sleeping, be it due to insomnia,
                                pain or other associated sleep issues.

                                Contrary to the deep all-body relaxation that
                                comes with the use of indica strains, sativas
                                are known for increasing the feeling of
                                creativity, enhancing focus and lessening
                                anxiety. This is more of a mind-centered high in
                                terms of how and where you will feel the
                                effects. Given its stimulating nature, it is
                                recommended to use this during the day.

                                Hybrid strains are just that - they combine the
                                head-focused high effects of sativas with the
                                bodily relaxation of indicas. This is ideal for
                                people who really want to sooth any fatigue and
                                worries while also clearing the mind ready to
                                focus fresh on something new. Hybrids are
                                expertly tailored to result in strains with
                                specific effects. Useful strain vocabulary to
                                familiarize yourself with when it comes to
                                hybrids includes sativa-dominant (full, bodily
                                relaxation), indica-dominant (boosting
                                creativity, increasing mood and lessening
                                anxiety) and balanced (the best of both worlds).
